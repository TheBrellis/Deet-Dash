# Deet-Dash
## Deet-Dash is a dashboard web application that delivers the details of your day. Utilizing several API's, Deet-Dash is able to provide the user with everything from a Joke of the Day, to the traffic on their morning commute.

    - I WANT To know know the date/time
    - SO THAT I can figure out what day it is

#### 2: Weather Card (Open Weather Map API)
    - AS A user 
    - I WANT To know the weather
    - SO THAT I know what to wear

#### 3: Joke of the Day Card (Rapid API: SlapBotAPI)
    - AS A user

    - SO THAT I can make friends happy

##### 4: This Day in History (history.muffinlabs.com API)
    - As a user
    - I WANT To know a bit of history
    - So THAT I can know more about history

### Future Cards:

##### Straight Forwards 
- Trivia
- This day in history

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks

1. Create Static Layout (3 Cards and a Header pulling info from API's)
- Sight themes (color-way, general layout, font, what a card looks like)
- Completion Date :  11/2

2. Add Dynamic Card creation (no user input) (add API)
- Completion Date : 11/3

3. a Add User Pick List for Card Selection (check boxes)

3. b Add User Input - Welcome Wizard- (check boxes) to specify what Cards to populate
- Completion Date : 11/5

#### MVP Complete 

4. Expand Card Type (to 6 cards)
- Completion Date : 11/6

5. Add User name Input to Welcome Wizard (name object), store Check Box info in localStorage()
- Completion Date : 11/7

#### Partially Done

6. Expand Card Type (to 9 cards) or 7 cards with 1 reacher.

## DO NOT CHANGE DATE 11/8



# Unit 7: Project 1

## Overview
Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics
* Server-side APIs
* Git branching workflow
* Agile software development

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is agile software development?
2. What is an MVP?
3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Explain agile software development
* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project
